# Vega and HydroCam

This program transmits data from a Vega Puls 21 and onboard sensors from a Stonefly data logger to Monitor My Watershed.
It also takes images from a Geolux HydroCam and saves those images to an SD card.
The camera images are **NOT** transmitted to any endpoint.

The instructions for this example are nearly identical to those for the [Hydros21 example](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/USGS_NGWOS/tree/main/NGWOS_Hydros21_HydroCam), but without Hydros21 or the easy way of removing the Vega Puls.
